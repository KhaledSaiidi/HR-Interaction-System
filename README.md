# HR-Interaction-System
This SpringBoot application was created as part of a study project to allow members of an organization to have a common virtual space in which they can create secure accounts via the web security spring bundle and self-certification through tokens. 
Users can reset their passwords via email in case they forget their passwords. 
Administrators can propose various topics and there will be a forum creation for these topics. 
Other users can contact each other through notifications, comments and chat. 
In the forums there is an advertising space for marketers to advertise their products and services if they have a subscription.  
Apart from the interaction in the forums, users have their own homepage where they can post publications. 
A complaint system is set up in a private way if there are problems for a user. The creation of events and the invitation of other users is also possible within the limits of the professional framework.
